# PURPOSE
This is a repository I am using to store "scratchoad-like" python scripts/modules that I develop as I learn the language and use it to do useful tasks for my day-to-day.

# ENVIRONMENT
I am using VSCode as my editor, have installed Python 3.10.7, and use the VSCode Python extension to run/debug the python files. I may also just directly run a python file from terminal with the python command.
